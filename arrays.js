// As you may know, an anagram is a new word created by reorganizing all the letters in a word.
// This array of anagrams are all based on the word "Stop"
let anagrams = ["plots", "post", "stop", "puts", "tops"]

// Run this program after you try each step and see if it worked.
// At the very bottom of this file is a line of code that prints out the array after your code as run.
// You're welcome to print additional debugging statements if you need.

// 1. Print out the third word in the array using bracket notation.





// 2. The word "opts" is also an anagram of the word "stop". Find a way to add "opts" to the end of the array.





// 3. The word "puts", on the other hand, is not an anagram of the word "stop". Find a way to replace it with the word "pots".





// 4. Use the documentation to figure out what the method ".pop()" does.
//   Now use it to remove the word "plots" (which isn't a correct anagram of "stop") from our array.





// 5. Put the final array of anagrams in alphabetical order.




// LEVEL 2: At this point, the tasks will get more challenging, because you'll work with datasets too large to handle by just looking at it and reading them.
// They're stored in another file called otherarrays.js, which is loaded before this one in the HTML.

// Pro-tip: to make this easier, scroll down and comment out the line "console.log(anagrams)" so that you aren't printing extra information.
// 6. The first array is called "fortunes" and contains fortune-cookie style fortunes. Print out the third fortune from the array.




// 7. Print out a random fortune from the array.




// 8. This array is huge, so it'd be helpful to know how many fortunes are listed. Find a way to print out the number of fortunes in the array.





// 9. Challenge: Out of all the fotunes that are there, it'd mess up the program if some were listed twice, but with a array that big, it could happen.
// Find a way to check and see whether any of the fortunes are duplicates. If so, find a way to delete those duplicates.







// This code prints the array after you've manipulated it above.
console.log(anagrams)
